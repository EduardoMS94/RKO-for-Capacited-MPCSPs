# RKO-for-Capacited-MPCSPs
This repository presents a decoder procedure to solve the capacited multi-period cutting Stock problem.

The original RKO framework is available at https://github.com/RKO-solver/Framework. For detailed instructions on how to execute the program, please refer to the documentation provided at the same link.

The RKO-for-Capacitated-MPCSPs repository provides the 12 sets of instances used in the paper, an illustrative example of the decoder, and the computational results obtained for the 3-minute execution time and the Gurobi Solver.
